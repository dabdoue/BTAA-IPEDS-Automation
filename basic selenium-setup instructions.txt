Instructions For Installing Selenium:

Download Anaconda For Windows here:
https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.11-Windows-x86_64.exe

In the installer, select the "Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable" checkbox that you will see on the 5th page of the installer.

Now you will be able to use python3 in any cli you wish, whether it be Powershell, CMD, or the Anaconda Prompt that gets installed with Anaconda.

Open up your preferred Terminal and type in the following commands to install some prerequisites:
conda install -c conda-forge selenium
pip install chromedriver-autoinstaller

Navigate to the directory where you have the 'auto-ipeds.py' file download, then run 'python auto_ipeds.py' 
    If you want to get data from certain years, create a file (ex: years_list.txt) and list the years you want data for in descending order like so:
        2019
        2018
        2016
    Then when you run the python code, now run it with 'python auto_ipeds.py years_list.txt' (name doesn't have to be years_list.txt, can be whatever years list file is called) 

    If you want to get data from certain UnitIDs, use a .uid file with the UnitIDs you want to get data for. An example of one looks like this:
        151351|Indiana University-Bloomington|Bloomington|IN
        147767|Northwestern University|Evanston|IL
        153658|University of Iowa|Iowa City|IA
        174066|University of Minnesota-Twin Cities|Minneapolis|MN
        144050|University of Chicago|Chicago|IL
        214777|Pennsylvania State University-Main Campus|University Park|PA
        204796|Ohio State University-Main Campus|Columbus|OH
        240444|University of Wisconsin-Madison|Madison|WI
        171100|Michigan State University|East Lansing|MI
        170976|University of Michigan-Ann Arbor|Ann Arbor|MI
        181464|University of Nebraska-Lincoln|Lincoln|NE
        243780|Purdue University-Main Campus|West Lafayette|IN
        145637|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Champaign|IL
        186380|Rutgers University-New Brunswick|New Brunswick|NJ
        163286|University of Maryland-College Park|College Park|MD

    If you do not have a .uid file, you can simply create a file (ex: unitids.txt) and format it like such (be sure to include the "|" character after each UnitID, with no spaces):
        151351|
        147767|
        153658|
        174066|
        144050|
        214777|
        204796|
        240444|
        171100|
        170976|
        181464|
        243780|
        145637|
        186380|
        163286|
    Then when you run the python code, now run it with 'python auto_ipeds.py unitids.txt' (name doesn't have to be unitids.txt, can be whatever unitID file is called) 

    If you want to specify years and UnitIDs, run 'python auto_ipeds.py unitids.txt years_list.txt' (order of file arguments doesn't matter)
